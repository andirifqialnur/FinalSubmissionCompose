Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though apples are also used commercially for vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce, and apple butter and are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of the global crop also is used for cider, wine, and brandy. Fresh apples are eaten raw or cooked. There are a variety of ways in which cooked apples are used; frequently, they are used as a pastry filling, apple pie being perhaps the archetypal American dessert.",

Avocados are native to the Western Hemisphere from Mexico south to the Andean regions and are widely grown in warm climates. Avocado fruits have greenish or yellowish flesh with a buttery consistency and a rich nutty flavour. They are often eaten in salads, and in many parts of the world they are eaten as a dessert. Mashed avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole, a characteristic saucelike condiment in Mexican cuisine. Avocados provide thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamin A, and in some varieties the flesh contains as much as 25 percent unsaturated oil.",

The banana is grown in the tropics, and, though it is most widely consumed in those regions, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability throughout the year. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet and are grown extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions; they are cooked when ripe or immature.

The fruit is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit) that is generally heart-shaped to nearly globular, measures about 2 cm (1 inch) in diameter, and varies in colour from yellow through red to nearly black. The acid content of the sweet cherry is low. The higher acid content of the sour cherry produces its characteristic tart flavour.

Today, it is grown all over the world. It goes by many names, including pitaya, pitahaya, and strawberry pear. The two most common types have bright red skin with green scales that resemble a dragon — hence the name. The most widely available variety has white pulp with black seeds, though a less common type with red pulp and black seeds exists as well. Another variety — referred to as yellow dragon fruit — has yellow skin and white pulp with black seeds. Dragon fruit may look exotic, but its flavors are similar to other fruits.

The lime fruit is a key ingredient in certain pickles and chutneys, and lime juice is used to flavour drinks, foods, and confections. Limeade and other lime-flavoured drinks have a flavour and bouquet quite distinct from those made from lemons (Citrus ×limon). The juice of lime fruits may be concentrated, dried, frozen, or canned.
